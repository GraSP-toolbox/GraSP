%Spreads elements in an array such that the number of empty cells is
%minimized.
%
%   [L, C] = GRASP_SUBAXIS_MATRIX_DIMENSIONS(nb_cells) returns the number
%   of lines and the number of columns to display nb_cells elements. gcf is
%   used to get the size of the current figure window.
%
%   [L, C] = GRASP_SUBAXIS_MATRIX_DIMENSIONS(figure_handle, nb_cells) idem
%   using the provided figure handle.
%
%   GRASP_SUBAXIS_MATRIX_DIMENSIONS(..., background) uses a background
%   image to obtain the relation between width and height instead of the
%   window.
