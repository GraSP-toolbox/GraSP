%Plots a graph filter spectral response, and its interpolation if

%
%   GRASP_SHOW_SPECTRAL_RESPONSE(axis_handle, graph, filter) plots the
%       frequency response and, if available its interpolation in the
%       spectral domain.
%
%   GRASP_SHOW_SPECTRAL_RESPONSE(..., signal) also plot a graph signal
%       spectral components before and after filtering.
