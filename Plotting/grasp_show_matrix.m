%Plots a matrix, with either regular square elements, or irregular ones.
%IMSHOW is a faster alternative but requires extra work to scale the plot.
%
%   GRASP_SHOW_MATRIX(axis_handle, M) Plots the matrix elements in the
%   plane.
%
%   GRASP_SHOW_MATRIX(..., X, Y) uses X as the horizontal coordinates of
%   the vertical lines, and Y as the vertical coordinates of teh horizontal
%   lines (there are one more coordinate for each than there are rows /
%   columns).
