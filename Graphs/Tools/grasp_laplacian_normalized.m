%Constructs the normalized Laplacian of the (possibly directed) graph.
%
%Note: The graph provided can be directed, but then all weights must be
%non-negative.
%
%   Gamma = GRASP_LAPLACIAN_NORMALIZED(graph) returns the Laplacian of the
%   graph provided using its adjacency matrix (see [Li & Zhang 2012:
%   Digraph Laplacian and the Degree of Asymmetry])
%
%   [Gamma, Phi] = GRASP_LAPLACIAN_NORMALIZED(...) returns also the
%   stationnary distribution Phi (diagonal matrix)
