%Determines the two farthest nodes of a graph.
%
%   [x,y] = GRASP_FARTHEST(graph) returns the two farthest nodes of graph.
%
%   GRASP_FARTHEST(..., 'adjacency_matrix', am) type of the adjacency
%   matrix of graph. Default is 'distance' (graph.A is a distance matrix).
%   Other possible values are:
%     * 'similarity' (the distance used is e^-A)
%     * 'gaussian_kernel' (the kernel is inverted to get the distance)
%     * 'dst_mat' (graph.distance will be used).
%
%   [x,y,distances] = GRASP_FARTHEST(...) also returns the matrix of
%   distances between every couple of points.
