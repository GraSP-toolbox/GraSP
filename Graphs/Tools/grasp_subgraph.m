%Computes a subgraph.
%
%NOTE: this function only updates the standard fields of the graph
%structure (see GRASP_STRUCT).
%
%   g = GRASP_SUBGRAPH(g, vertex_set) remove the vertex not in vertex_set
%   from the graph g.
%
%   [..., mapping] = GRASP_SUBGRAPH(...) also outputs the mapping from the
%   old vertex index to the new vertex index (0 if not included).
