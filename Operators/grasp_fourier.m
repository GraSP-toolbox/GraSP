%Performs the Fourier transform with respect to a graph.
%
%   input_hat = GRASP_FOURIER(graph, input) if input is a vector, then
%   returns the fourier transform of input. If input is matrix, then input
%   is interpreted as an operator on signals on graph and input_hat is this
%   operator in the Fourier domain.
